## 🧩 Project Description  
on chain spin game with randome prize  logic is a blockchain-based project built to demonstrate the power of smart contracts and decentralized applications.  
This repository contains the core logic and deployment details of the smart contract that powers the XXX ecosystem.

---

## 💡 What It Does  
This project provides a simple yet powerful way to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum network.  
By deploying the contract, users can experiment with core blockchain features such as:  
- Smart contract interaction  
- Token management (if applicable)  
- Reading and writing data on-chain  

Whether you’re a developer looking to learn, or someone exploring how decentralized systems work, XXX serves as a great starting point.
